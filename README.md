# Wayback photos

I wanted to find an easy way to look through all of the photos from a given websites that are available in wayback machine. Why? I opened an old snapshot of my high school website and it made be wonder how my school looked like years before I started going there.

This is a simple proof of concept for now but I plan to turn it into a web app in a future. We'll see how it goes.
